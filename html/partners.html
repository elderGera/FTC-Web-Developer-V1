                Education
                and Training Act, SOLAS is an agency of the Department of Education and Skills and is governed by a
                Board.
                SOLAS funded through the Department of Education and Skills and is the State organisation with
                responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating Further Education and Training (FET) in Ireland,

                <h2>The European Social Fund (ESF)</h2>

                <img class="partnes-img" src="../asset/images/our-partners/eu-logo.webp" alt="EU partnes logo">
                <p>
                    The European Social Fund (ESF) is the European Union’s main financial instrument for helping people
                    seeking employment through investment in education, skills, and employment support. It does this by
                    investing in Europe’s people and their skills – employed and jobless, young, and old.
                    The ESF channels money into helping Member States meet the goals they have agreed together for
                    educating
                    and training people throughout Europe through the Europe 2020 strategy. Its mission is, to help
                    prevent
                    and fight unemployment, to make Europe’s workforce better equipped to face new challenges and to
                    prevent
                    people losing touch with the labour market.
                    The Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning, PEIL for short, is the only ESF programme
                    in
                    Ireland for the 2014 to 2020 period. It was formally approved by the European Commission in February
                    2015 and was launched in April of that year. The Programme involves a total investment of €1.157
                    billion; over €544 million each from the ESF and the Irish Government and a special allocation of
                    just
                    over €68 million from the EU’s Youth Employment Initiative.
                    The European Social Fund along with the Irish Government provides co-funding for eligible further
                    education and training programmes. Since Ireland joined the EU, the ESF has invested over €7 billion
                    in
                    education, training, and employment creation in Ireland.</p>
