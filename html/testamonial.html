                        I found the course to be quite easy and even boring sometimes because I am already familiar with
                        the
                        web development industry and the technology and tools we are covering as part of this course.
                        What
                        brought me here is working alongside senior developers within the Finglas Training Centre
                        Partners
                        company. As part of the course, we will be working on real-world projects for 3-months under the
                        supervision of experienced developers. It helps to build a decent portfolio of projects that
                        have
                        real-life impacts.

                        Before joining the Front-End Web Developer Traineeship this February, I had no background in
                        coding.
                        I have always been fascinated by what computer technology has to offer. Our dedicated instructor
                        plays an essential role in my learning journey, ensuring that I understand and learn all the
                        concepts regardless my initial lack of experience. As I look forward to completing the
                        traineeship
                        next year, I am confident that the opportunity I was given to participate in this course will
                        contribute to a personal and professional growth that will set the foundation for a successful
                        career in front-end web development! .

                        As a current student of the Front-End Web Developer Traineeship course, I can say that this
                        program
                        has exceeded my expectations. I have experience coding and building website previously, but this
                        course gives me to improve my soft skills, like communication and working with team members. We
                        are
                        building group projects. Not just writing code for the website, but we build websites from
                        scratch
                        itâ€™s include documented project plan, copywrite and wireframes. The instructor is great. She
                        always
                        response to our questions and always help to us. I would highly recommend this course to anyone
                        who
                        is interested in a career in web development.

                        Before this course, I only had experience with simple website development and did it myself. Now
                        I
                        am glad that I got into this course "Front End Web Developer Traineeship", where all training
                        takes
                        place in a team, which gives me the opportunity to acquire and consolidate knowledge in this
                        field
                        and to gain experience working in a company that I have not had before. Special thanks to our
                        instructor, who supports and helps at any time, even outside working hours. I recommend this
                        course
                        for people who want to get into the world "Front End Web Developer".
